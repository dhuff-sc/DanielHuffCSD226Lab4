# Full-Stack Development Labs 1 - 4

## Full-Stack Bookstore Project using Spring Boot / Spring Web

This repo is a college bookstore project utilizing Spring Web, HTMX and RESTful APIs to create a Multi-Page Application with authentication/authorization using JWT.

The purpose of these labs was to demonstrate the capabilities and utilization of the above systems to create protected screens, admin privileges, JWT token (and refresh),
and utilize a MySQL database to manage user credentials and refresh tokens.

As of yet, I haven't been able to properly implement the project to a CI/CD pipeline and continued to demonstrate the projects in the CSD226CICD repo.
